tumblrpx is a fast & fun way to make slideshows out of tumblr.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saihgupr/redditpx.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd redditpx
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Get a Tumblr API Key. You can get one by following these steps:
   1. Go to [https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps) and click "Register a new application".
   2. Fill out the application details. The "Application Website" and "Default callback URL" can be set to any valid URL, for example `https://localhost`.
   3. Once registered, you will see your "OAuth Consumer Key". This is your API key.
5. Create a file named `src/config.js` and add your API key to it, like this:
   ```javascript
   // src/config.js
   export const API_KEY = 'YOUR_TUMBLR_API_KEY';
   ```

### Usage

```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start a development server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

To create a production version of the app:
```sh
npm run build
```

To run the production version:
```sh
npm run start
```
